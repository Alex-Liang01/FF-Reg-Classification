# Forest Fire Linear Regression

Linear Regression and hyper parameter tuning project using the Forest Fire dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php]

The variables are as follows: X, Y, month, day, FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, temp, RH, wind, rain, and area.

X is the x-axis coordinates from the Montesinho park map
Y is the y-axis coordinates from the Motesinho park map
month is the most of the year
day is the day of the week
FFMC is the index of FFMC from the FWI system
DMC is the index of DMC from the FWI system
Dc is the index of DC from the FWI system
ISI is the index of ISI from the FWI system
temp is the temperature in degrees Celsius
RH is the relative humidty in percentage
wind is the windspeed in km/h
rain is the amount of rain in mm
area is the amount of burned area in ha
